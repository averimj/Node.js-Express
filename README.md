This portfolio showcases the last five projects Iâ€™ve done while in the Treehouse Apprenticeship Program(TAP). The portfolio itself is the sixth project I've created using node.js and express. The portfolio website has 3 main components, a **home** page (index), **about** and **project** page, displaying the skills and knowledge gained while pursuing a career as a Junior Developer. 

Here is a live-link to the portfolio: https://nodejs-express6.herokuapp.com/
